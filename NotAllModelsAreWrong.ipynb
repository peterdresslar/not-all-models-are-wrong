    "\n",
    "This week, with the start of two foundational Masters-level Complexity Sciences courses, the same quotation was shared in each as the central basis of the week's discussion to open our exploration of model design and emergent phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"All models are wrong. Some are useful.\"[^1]\n",
    "\n",
    "This famous saying—promulgated by prominent twentieth-century statistician George Box—is one of the more widely-known commentaries on modeling discipline: so much so, that it has its own Wikipedia page.[^2] \n",
    "\n",
    "However, speaking at least from a contemporary perspective, one wonders how helpful it is to welcome new students and prospective practicioners to an exploration in complexity science with such a quixotic passage. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, is \"All models are wrong...\" useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">. . .</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get ahead of ourselves, it seems appropriate to discuss the context of the aphorism[^3] in which it was originally published.[^4] Here it is quoted from Box's book chapter, *Robustness in the Strategy of Scientific Model Building*, published in 1979. In the following quote, the capitalization and lack of internal punctuation are both taken from the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    ">ALL MODELS ARE WRONG BUT SOME ARE USEFUL ... Now it would be very remarkable if any system existing in the real world could be exactly represented by any simple model. However, cunningly chosen parsimonious models often do provide remarkably useful approximations. For example, the law PV = RT relating pressure P, volume V and temperature T of an \"ideal\" gas via a constant R is not exactly true for any real gas, but it frequently provides a useful approximation and furthermore its structure is informative since it springs from a physical view of the behavior of gas molecules. For such a model there is no need to ask the question \"Is the model true?\". If \"truth\" is to be the \"whole truth\" the answer must be \"No\". The only question of interest is \"Is the model illuminating and useful?\".[^5] \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there are actually two seperate ideas hinted at in the discussion here. The first is the difficulty in replicating real-world conditions in the form of model math with absolute fidelity. The second is the idea that the value of a model is independent of such fidelity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these two ideas is developed at length in the chapter, though the latter one is tempered through rigorous discussion of methods for model \"Robustification.\"[^6] As Box was a statistician, those Robustification methods are unsurprisingly rooted deeply in analytical methods from that field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box would go on to utter the phrase in various forms at conferences and other fora, seemingly as sort of a \"catch phrase\" that caught on. In his writings and from the discussion of his life on his Wikipedia entry and other authors, it seems very clear that Box was both an iconoclast and—to leverage this author's lived experience—very much a man of his place and time. The pithiness of \"all models are wrong\" suited those places and times quite well. \n",
    "\n",
    "But places and times have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some academics have commented on the quotation over the years, with at least a few of them seeming to take a bit of issue with it.\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Finally it does not seem helpful just to say that all models are wrong. The very word model implies simplification and idealization. The idea that complex physical, biological or sociological systems can be exactly described by a few formulae is patently absurd. The construction of idealized representations that capture important stable aspects of such systems is, however, a vital part of general scientific analysis...\" [^7]\n",
    "\n",
    "This commentary, by David Cox, appears in the commentary from a well-cited paper by Chris Chatfield called *Model Uncertainty, Data Mining and Statistical Inference.* Intriguingly, the comment appears to mix up elements of the Box discussion, given that Box actually refers to an \"idealized system\" in his prose. It would seem, perhaps, that Cox did not actually have access to the Box.[^8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, his point is well-taken. What else would models exist to do, except to translate the systems of the world around us into \"logical devices\" through which we can generate understanding and predictive ability? And if such models are providing such utility, to the degree that we are able to trust them, how could we call them wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly fifty years after Box's first coinage of the saying, we are unquestionably living in a new regime of thinking; or, by the estimate of some, a new regime of *un*-thinking. Readers will need little reminder of society's changing attitudes toward basic sciences and the nature of facts themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">...</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not Box's quotation is useful, it is certainly wrong.\n",

There would be dozens or hundreds of ways to implement the simulation correctly: though, with the enumeration of many correct models, the distinctions between successful implementations would probably become increasingly trivial. Then, if we imagine the very edges of the class of correct (but perhaps overly complicated or oblique) model implementations, we might imagine what lies beyond: myriad possible failing models. Models that fail to account for the extra leap years a certain modulos, or that just do not add fours correctly. Of course, all these definitely-wrong models must supremely outnumber the right ones, as there should be infinitely many ways to get a model to fail. After all, we can always add another operator and another Greek letter, and, *voila*, the model is still bad.\n",

    "In fact we might expect the same arrangement to be found with all other models of mundane, universal phenomena: a small kernel of correct models, perhaps a larger cloud of nearly correct models, and then an enveloping sea of wrong answers.\n",

    "Grounding our discussion into the earthly domain, observers of the sciences starting prior to the Twentieth Century, and particularly through the middle years of the second half of that century, have increasingly become skeptical regarding the veracity of many different mathematical approaches to representing our world. These waves of skepticism range from criticism of the real mathematical fidelity of models to real world sources of data---of this wave, Box was certainly a strong proponent---to more general concerns about the ability of scientists to accurately gather data and model phenomena with sufficient precision, especially in complex arenas like ecology and fields of human study. Roughly mid-century in *Cybernetics*, Norbert Wiener aptly summed up these concerns with an analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  [T]he human sciences are very poor testing- grounds for a new mathematical technique: as poor as the statistical mechanics of a gas would be to a being of the order of size of a molecule, to whom the fluctuations which we ignore from a larger standpoint would be precisely the matters of greatest interest. [^17]\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors like Feyeraband and Kuhn go even further, questioning the ability of scientists to in many cases extract themselves with their own perceptual biases, and, crucially, vocational constraints and social limitations. Indeed, reproducability is a well-known problem in many fields of research, and the strong social influences on science from the industry of science, the authors argue, have the effect of higher production of lower quality science, including models.\n",
    "\n",
    "That these arguments do seem to have arrived in waves, spaced roughly every generation starting just before the turn of the Twentieth Century, suggests that there is a strong historigraphic framework driving acceptance of model development. While that framework is beyond the ken of this essay, we can turn our attention to the close of the century to sum up the challenges facing model integrity. To do that, we have this lengthy introduction by Steven Pincus from his work, *Approximate entropy as a measure of system complexity*:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In an effort to understand complex phenomena, investigators throughout science are considering chaos as a possible underlying model. Formulas have been developed to characterize chaotic behavior, in particular to encapsulate properties of strange attractors that represent long-term system dynamics. Recently it has become apparent that in many settings nonmathematicians are applying new \"formulas\" and algorithms to experimental time-series data prior to careful statistical examination... While mathematical analysis of known deterministic systems is an interesting and deep problem, blind application of algorithms is dangerous, particularly so here. Even for low-dimensional chaotic systems, a huge number of points are needed to achieve convergence in these dimension and entropy algorithms, though they are often applied with an insufficient number of points. [^18]\n",
    "\n",
    "Pincus succinctly sums up many of the concerns of all of our prior references here, and, happily, assigns them to the problem that is generating those concerns. That is to say, Pincus specifically targets complex phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the fact that complex phenomena are so difficult to work with in systematic representations is particularly vexing to human beings: we live and breath chaos; as living beings we effectively *are* chaos. We are staggeringly multidimensional, perhaps infinitely so. And thus many of the models we are most interested in---ways to make our society more healthy, or less violent, or more fair---are the most difficult of all to work with. Surely *all* of the models dealing with human behavior are wrong, to some degree. There is no way they could be right.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, complex phenomena are, generally speaking, the reason that many wrong models are wrong. Out of the Pincus quotation as a whole, we might call out the phrase \"even for low-dimensional chaotic systems.\" It might be noted that this phrase keenly recalls the specific quotation from Box and his gas equations! The difference here being that Pincus has called out a *specific class* of phenomena, for whose models we might especially worry. And then, quite agreeably, he goes on in his article to try to fix those models, at least a to some degree.\n"
